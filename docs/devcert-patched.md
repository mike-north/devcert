## devcert-patched package

Utilities for safely generating locally-trusted and machine-specific X.509 certificates for local development

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [certificateFor(commonName, alternativeNames, options, partialCertOptions)](./devcert-patched.certificatefor.md) | Request an SSL certificate for the given app name signed by the devcert root certificate authority. If devcert has previously generated a certificate for that app name on this machine, it will reuse that certificate.<!-- -->If this is the first time devcert is being run on this machine, it will generate and attempt to install a root certificate authority.<!-- -->If <code>options.getCaBuffer</code> is true, return value will include the ca certificate data as { ca: Buffer }<!-- -->If <code>options.getCaPath</code> is true, return value will include the ca certificate path as { caPath: string } |
|  [certificateFor(commonName, options, partialCertOptions)](./devcert-patched.certificatefor_1.md) | Request an SSL certificate for the given app name signed by the devcert root certificate authority. If devcert has previously generated a certificate for that app name on this machine, it will reuse that certificate.<!-- -->If this is the first time devcert is being run on this machine, it will generate and attempt to install a root certificate authority.<!-- -->If <code>options.getCaBuffer</code> is true, return value will include the ca certificate data as { ca: Buffer }<!-- -->If <code>options.getCaPath</code> is true, return value will include the ca certificate path as { caPath: string } |
|  [getCertExpirationInfoData(subjectName, businessDaysBuffer, now, fetchCertExpirationInfo)](./devcert-patched.getcertexpirationinfodata.md) | Retrieve a certificate by Subject Name and return its expiration state and expiration date |
|  [hasCertificateFor(commonName)](./devcert-patched.hascertificatefor.md) | Check whether a certificate with a given common\_name has been installed |
|  [removeAndRevokeDomainCert(commonName)](./devcert-patched.removeandrevokedomaincert.md) | Remove a certificate and revoke it from the OpenSSL cert database |
|  [removeDomain(commonName)](./devcert-patched.removedomain.md) | Remove a certificate |
|  [uninstall()](./devcert-patched.uninstall.md) | Remove as much of the devcert files and state as we can. This is necessary when generating a new root certificate, and should be available to API consumers as well.<!-- -->Not all of it will be removable. If certutil is not installed, we'll leave Firefox alone. We try to remove files with maximum permissions, and if that fails, we'll silently fail.<!-- -->It's also possible that the command to untrust will not work, and we'll silently fail that as well; with no existing certificates anymore, the security exposure there is minimal. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [CaBuffer](./devcert-patched.cabuffer.md) | The CA public key as a buffer |
|  [CaPath](./devcert-patched.capath.md) | The cert authority's path on disk |
|  [CertExpirationInfo](./devcert-patched.certexpirationinfo.md) | Certificate expiration information based on the cert expiration date and a renewal window based in business days |
|  [CertOptions](./devcert-patched.certoptions.md) | Certificate options |
|  [DomainData](./devcert-patched.domaindata.md) | Domain cert public and private keys as buffers |
|  [Options](./devcert-patched.options.md) | Cert generation options |
|  [UserInterface](./devcert-patched.userinterface.md) | A representation of several parts of the local system that the user interacts with |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [CertFreshnessState](./devcert-patched.certfreshnessstate.md) | Get the certificate expiration state |
|  [IReturnCa](./devcert-patched.ireturnca.md) | A return value containing the CA public key |
|  [IReturnCaPath](./devcert-patched.ireturncapath.md) | A return value containing the CA path on disk |
|  [IReturnData](./devcert-patched.ireturndata.md) | A return value containing the CA public key, CA path on disk, and domain cert info |
